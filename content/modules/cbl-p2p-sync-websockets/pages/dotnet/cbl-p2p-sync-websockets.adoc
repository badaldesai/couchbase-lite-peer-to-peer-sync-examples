This tutorial uses a simple inventory tracker app to demonstrate the peer-to-peer database sync functionality introduced in Couchbase Lite 2.8.2.


== Introduction

Couchbase Lite 2.8.2 release supports out-of-the-box support for secure link:https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/csharp/learn/csharp-landing-p2psync.html[Peer-to-Peer Sync], over websocket, between Couchbase Lite enabled clients in IP-based networks without the need for a centralized control point (i.e. you do not need a Sync Gateway or Couchbase Server to get peer-to-peer database sync going)


This tutorial will demonstrate how to -

* Use UDP type socket to listen on specified port for peer discovery. Broadcast it's own IP address over UDP type socket. 
** NOTE: UWP app needs to be added to the Exception list on the Windows Firewall.
* Configure a websocket listener to listen to incoming requests. We will walk through various TLS modes and client authentication modes.
* Start a bi-directional replication from active peer.
* Sync data between connected peers

Throughout this tutorial, the terms "passive peer" and "server" and "listener" will be used interchangeably to refer to the peer on which the websocket listener is started. The "active peer" and "client" will be used interchageably to refer to the peer on which the replicator is initialized.

We will be using simple inventory apps in Xamarin UWP, iOS, and Android as an example to demonstrate the peer-to-peer functionality.
====
You can learn more about Couchbase Lite https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/introduction.html[here]
====

== Prerequisites
*Visual Studio 2019 with:
**Universal Windows Platform component installed.
**Xamarin component installed (for Android and iOS development).
+
This tutorial assumes familiarity with building Xamarin apps with Visual Studio and with Couchbase Lite.

* If you are unfamiliar with the basics of Couchbase Lite, it is recommended that you follow the link:https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/csharp/start/csharp-gs-install.html[Getting Started] guides

* Visual Studio
** Download latest version from the link:https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/[Microsoft Website]

* Wi-Fi network that the peers can communicate over
** You could run your peers in multiple simulators. But if you were running the app on real devices, then you will need to ensure that the devices are on the same WiFi network

== App Overview
This is a simple inventory app that can be used as a link:https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/csharp/advance/csharp-p2psync-websocket-using-passive.html[passive] or link:https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/csharp/advance/csharp-p2psync-websocket-using-active.html[active peer].

The app uses a local database that is pre-populated with data. There is no Sync Gateway or Couchbase Server installed.

When used as a passive peer :-

* Users log in and start websocket listener for the couchbase lite database. Listener IPEndpoint is advertised over UDP type socket when users enter the `ListenerPage`.
* View the status of connected clients
* Directly sync data with connected clients

When used as a active peer :-

* Users can log in and enter the `ListenersBrowserPage` to start browsing for peers
* Connect to a listener
* Directly sync data with connected clients

== App Installation

- Clone the repo
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/couchbaselabs/couchbase-lite-peer-to-peer-sync-websocket-samples/
----

=== Try it Out
* Open the Xamarin .Net project using Visual Studio
* Build and run the project
** Note: For UWP, don't run until you do this: On a 64-bit Windows, select "Debug" for Solution Configurations and "x64" for Solution Platforms on VS and Deploy the UWP app. After successfully deployed the app, you can run the app by clicking "Local Machine".
* Verify that you see the login screen
* If you are having trouble running the Xamarin iOS sample app, please see <<Having issue running the Xamarin iOS app?>> 
+

== Exploring the App Project

- The Xamarin .Net project comes pre-bundled with some resource files that we will examine here

image::cs-project-explorer.png[alt=xcode project explorer,width=640,height=480]

* `userdb.cblite2.zip` : A zip file contains prebuild Couchbase Lite database. It includes the data for a single document. See <<Data Model>>
* `userallowlist.json` : List of valid client users (and passwords) in the system. This list is looked up when the server tries to authenticate credentials associated with incoming connection request.
* `listener-cert-pkey.p12` : This is link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PKCS_12[PKCS12] file archive that includes a public key cert corresponding to the listener and associated private key. The cert is a sample cert that was generated using link:https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL] tool.
* `listener-pinned-cert.cer` : This is the public key listener cert (the same cert that is embedded in the `listener-cert-pkey.p12` file) in DER encoded format. This cert is pinned on the client replicator and is used for validating server cert during connection setup

== Data Model
Couchbase Lite is a JSON Document Store. A Document is a logical collection of named fields and values. The values are any valid JSON types. In addition to the standard JSON types, Couchbase Lite supports some special types like `Date` and `Blob`.
While it is not required or enforced, it is a recommended practice to include a _"type"_ property that can serve as a namespace for related.

=== The "List" Document
The app deals with a single Document with a _"type"_ property of _"list"_.

An example of a document would be

```json
{
    "type":"list",
    "list":[
      {
         "image":{"length":16608,"digest":"sha1-LEFKeUfywGIjASSBa0l/cg5rlm8=","content_type":"image/jpeg","@type":"blob"},
          "value":10,
          "key":"Apples"
      },
      {
        "image":{"length":16608,"digest":"sha1-LEFKeUsswGIjASssSBa0l/cg5rlm8=","content_type":"image/jpeg","@type":"blob"},
        "value":110,
        "key":"oranges"
       }
    ]

}
```

=== Initializing Local Database

The app extract prebuild database zip file named `userdb.cblite2.zip` into `DBPath` the first time the database is created. This is done regardless of whether the app is launched in passive or active mode.

* Open the *CoreApp.cs* file and locate the `LoadAndInitDB()` method. This method extract and place the Couchbase Lite database in `DBPath` for the user if one does not exist.

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=OpenOrCreateDatabase]
----

* Open the *SeasonalItemsViewModel.cs* file and locate the `SeasonalItemsViewModel()` constructor. It creates LiveQuery to pick up document changes in the inventory list array when the ViewModel load the first time. Each array item contains a dictionary with 3 pairs of key value, and keys are "key", "value", and "image" and their values are mapped to the properties `Name`, `Quantity`, and `Image` in .Net Object `SeasonalItem`. The "image" property holds a blob entry to an image. 

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=LoadData]
----

== Passive Peer or Server
First, we will walk through the steps of using the app in passive peer mode


=== Initializing Websocket Listener
* Open the *ListenerViewModel.cs* file and locate the `CreateListener()` function. This is where the websocket listsner for peer-to-peer sync is initialized


[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=InitListener]
----
<1> Initialize the `URLEndpointListenerConfiguration` for the specified database. There is a listener for a given database. You can specify a port to be associated with the listener. In our app, we let Couchbase Lite choose the port.
<2> This is where we configure the TLS mode. In the app, we have a flag named `ListenerTLSMode` that allows the app to switch between the various modes. You can change the mode by changing the value of the variable. See <<Testing Different TLS Modes>>
<3> Enable delta sync. It is disabled by default
<4> Configure the password authenticator callback function that authenticates the  username/password received from the client during replication setup. The list of valid users are configured in `userallowlist.json` file bundled with the app

==== Testing Different TLS Modes
The app can be configured to test different TLS modes as follows by setting the `ListenerTLSMode` property in the `CoreApp.cs` file

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=ListenerValidationTestMode]
----

[cols="2,2", options="header"]
.TLS Modes on Listener
|===
|ListenerTLSMode Value |Behavior

| DISABLED
| There is no TLS. All communication is plaintext (insecure mode and not recommended in production)


| WITH_ANONYMOUS_AUTH
| The app uses self-signed cert that is auto-generated by Couchbase Lite as `TLSIdentity` of the server. While server authentication is skipped, all encryption is still encrypted. This is the default mode of Couchbase Lite.


| WITH_BUNDLED_CERT
| The app generates `TLSIdentity` of the server from  public key cert and private key bundled in the `listener-cert-pkey.p12` archive. Communication is encrypted


| WITH_GENERATED_SELF_SIGNED_CERT
| The app uses Couchbase Lite `CreateIdentity` convenience API to generate the `TLSIdentity` of the server. Communication is encrypted


|===

=== Start Websocket Listener
* Open the *ListenerViewModel.cs* file and locate the `ExecuteStartListenerCommand()` method.

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=StartListener]
----

=== Advertising Listener Service
In the app, we broadcast listener's IPEndpoint over UDP type socket.

* Open the *ListenerViewModel.cs* file and look for `Broadcast` method. Here, we create a Socket with Udp ProtocolType and broadcast listener's IPEndpoint to the peers are listening in local network. Please note, this App requires peers to start peer discovery before listener start broadcasting. Otherwise, you will have to manually broadcast the listener IP. Please see "Try it out" for detail.

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=StartAdvertiser]
----

=== Stop Websocket Listener
* Open the *ListenerViewModel.cs* file and locate the `ExecuteStartListenerCommand()` method. You can stop the listener after the listener is started.

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=StopListener]
----

=== Try it out
* Run the app on a simulator or a real device. If its the latter, make sure you sign your app with the appropriate developer certificate
* On login screen, sign in as any one of the users configured in the `userallowlist.json` file such as "bob" and "password"
* You can find 4 selections (`What's in Season?`, `Listener`, `Browser`, and `Logout`) under "hamburger" menu locates on the upper left hand side.
* From the `ListenerPage` after select `Listener` from the "hamburger" menu, start the listener by clicking on "Start Listener" button
* You can see 2 toolbar items (`Broadcast` and `Peers`) 
** NOTE: These two items will do nothing if listener is not started.
* Click on the "Peers" toolbar item to see number of connected clients. It should be 0 if there are no connected clients
* Click on the "Broadcast" toolbar item to broadcast the listener ip endpoint if you don't see the listener's ip endpoint showing up on peers' `ListenersBrowserPage`
* From the `ListenerPage`, stop the listener by clicking on "Stop Listener" button

== Active Peer or Client
We will walk through the steps of using the app in active peer mode

=== Discovering Listeners
In the app, we use UDP Type Socket to listen on port 15000 for listener. Please note, port 15000 is used by UDP Type Socket, not used by the websocket listener. Couchbase Lite choose the port when a websocket listener is created.

* Open the *ListenersBrowserViewModel.cs* file and look for `ListenersBrowserViewModel` constructor. Here, we create a `UdpListener` with the port it listens on and pick up any raised Udp packet received event (Listner's broadcasting IPEndpoint).

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=StartBrowsing]
----
Explore the content in the `UdpListener.cs`. It includes implementation of creating Socket with Udp ProtocolType, start and stop the listner, and `UdpPacketReceived` EventHandler.


=== Initializing and Starting Replication
Initialilzing a replicator for peer-to-peer sync is fundamentally the same as the case if the Couchbase Lite client were to link:https://docs.couchbase.com/couchbase-lite/current/csharp/learn/csharp-replication.html#starting-a-replication[sync] with a remote Sync Gateway. 

* Open the *ReplicatorItem.cs* file and locate the `ExecuteStartReplicatorCommand()` method. If you have been using Couchbase Lite to sync data with Sync Gateway, this code should seem very familiar. In this function, we initialize a bi-directional replication to the listener peer in continuous mode. We also register a Replication Listener to be notified of status to the replication status.

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=StartReplication]
----

<1> Initialize a Repicator Configuration for the specified local database and remote listener URL endpoint
<2> This is where we configure the TLS server cert validation mode - whether we enable cert validation or skip validation. This would only apply if you had enabled TLS support on listener as discussed in <<TLS Modes on Listener>>. If you skip server cert validation,  you still get encrypted communication, but you are communicating with a untrusted listener. In the app, we have a flag named `ListenerCertValidationMode` that allows you to try the various modes. You can change the mode by changing the value of the variable. See <<Testing Different Server Authentication Modes>>
<3> The app uses basic client authentication to authenticate with the server
<4> Initialize the Replicator
<5> Start replication. The app uses the events on the Replicator Listener to listen to monitor the replication.

==== Testing Different Server Authentication Modes
In <<Initializing Websocket Listener>> section, we discussed the various ways the listener TLSIdentity can be configured. Here, we describe the corresponding changes on the replicator side to authenticate the server identity. The app can be configured to test different TLS modes as follows by setting the `ListenerCertValidationMode` property in the `CoreApp.cs` file.

Naturally, if you had initialized the listener with `TLSDisabled` mode, then skip this section as there is no TLS.

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=ListenerValidationTestMode]
----

[cols="2,2", options="header"]
.TLS Listener Cert Authentication
|===
|ListenerCertValidationMode Value |Behavior

| SKIP_VALIDATION
| There is no authentication of server cert. The server cert is a self-signed cert. This is typically in used in dev or test environments. Skipping server cert authentication is discouraged in production environments. Communication is encrypted.


| ENABLE_VALIDATION
| If the listener cert is from well known CA then you will use this mode. Of course, in our sample app, the listener cert as specified in `listener-cert-pkey` is a self signed cert - so you probably will not use this mode to test. But if you have a CA signed cert, you can configure your listener with the CA signed cert and use this mode to test. Communication is encrypted


| ENABLE_VALIDATION_WITH_CERT_PINNING
| In this mode, the app uses the pinned cert,`listener-pinned-cert.cer` that is bundled in the app to validate the listener identity. Only the server cert that exactly matches the pinned cert will be authenticated. Communication is encrypted


|===

=== Stopping Replication

* Open the *ReplicatorItem.cs* file and locate the `StopReplicator()` method. If you have been using Couchbase Lite to sync data with Sync Gateway, this code should seem very familiar. In this function, we remove any listeners attached to the replicator and stop it. You can restart the replicator with `ExecuteStartReplicatorCommand()` method

[source,C#]
----
include::example$code-samples.cs[tags=StopReplication]
----

=== Try it out
* Follow instructions in "Try It Out" section of <<Passive Peer or Server>> to start app in passive mode on a simulator instance or real device.
* Run the app on a separate simulator instance or a real device. If its the latter, make sure you sign your app with the appropriate developer certificate
* On login screen, sign in as any one of the users configured in the `userallowlist.json` file such as "bob" and "password". An an exercise, try with an invalid user and ensure it fails
* You can find 4 selections (`What's in Season?`, `Listener`, `Browser`, and `Logout`) under "hamburger" menu locates on the upper left hand side.
* Select "Broswer" from the "hamburger" menu. The app automatically browses for listener and lists it here when any listener is broadcasting. 
** NOTE: If the listener is not started before listeners browser ("Broswer") is selected, you will need to click `Broadcast` toolbar item locates on top of the `ListenerPage` (See `Broadcast` in <<Passive Peer or Server>>)
** NOTE: You will need to manually enter the listener's IP Endpoint (ex. 192.168.0.14:59840) for Xamarin android app.
* Tap on the row corresponding to listener. This will start replication with the listener and it shoud transition to Connected state
* Verify the connection count on listener by clicking "Peers" toolbar item locates on top of the `ListenerPage` (See `Broadcast` in <<Passive Peer or Server>>)
* Tap on the row corresponding to listener again. This will stop replication with the listener and it shoud transition to Disonnected state. Try Disconnect and then reconnect again
* Swipe left (iOS) or long press (Android) or left click (UWP) on the the row. You should see the option to remove listener

== Syncing Data
Once the connection is established between the peers, you can start syncing. Couchbase Lite takes care of it.


=== Try it out
* Run the app on two or more simulators or real devices. If its the latter, make sure you sign your app with the appropriate developer certificate
* Start the listener on one of the app instances. You could also have multiple listeners.
* Connect the other instances of the app to the listener
* You can find 4 selections (`What's in Season?`, `Listener`, `Browser`, and `Logout`) under "hamburger" menu locates on the upper left hand side.
* Enter `SeasonalItemsPage` by selecting "What's in Season?" from the "hamburger" menu.
* Edit the quanity and/or image on one or multiple instance(s) and press Save when you are done editing
* Watch it sync automatically to other connected clients

== What Next
As an exercise, switch between the various TLS modes and server cert validation modes and see how the app behaves. You can also try with different topologies to connect the peers.

== Learn More
Congratulations on completing this tutorial!

This tutorial walked you through an example of how to directly synchronize data between Couchbase Lite enabled clients. While the tutorial is for Xamarin .Net, the concepts apply equally to other Couchbase Lite platforms.

=== Toubleshoot 

==== Having issue running the Xamarin iOS app?
* Xamarin iOS p2p sample app should build and run with Visual Studio 2019 with latest updates and XCode 12.0.1
* If you have Xcode 11 and try to run the iOS app on simulator and the simulator is not loading, try launch the simulator via Xcode and select that simulator when launching it from VS.

=== Connecting to Android emulator over localhost
When starting listener on Android emulator and trying to connect it from another emulator or iOS simulator on localhost, the following steps must be followed
1) Setup port forwarding .For instance if listener is listening on port 35262 , then command to be run on terminal of host machine would be
[source,bash]
----
adb forward tcp:35262 tcp:35262
----
2) You cannot connect to emulator directly over localhost. Regardless of what the IPAddress is in the URL that's displayed , the replicator app must ignore it and use "127.0.0.1" as host address. So if listener is listening on "10.2.0.15: 35262" , then you must connect to URL "127.0.0.1: 35262"

=== Cannot connect Android app's active peer to passive peer if you are using Xamarin.Android SDK 9.x or other older version?
Go to `Advanced Android Options` (Android Project Properties -> Android Options -> Advanced button) and change `SSL/TLS implementation` configuratino to `Managed TLS 1.0` from `Native TLS 1.2+`.
